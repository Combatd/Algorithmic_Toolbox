Task. The goal in this problem is to find the minimum number of coins needed to change the input value
(an integer) into coins with denominations 1, 5, and 10.

Input Format. The input consists of a single integer ùëö.

Constraints. 1 ‚â§ ùëö ‚â§ 103.

Output Format. Output the minimum number of coins with denominations 1, 5, 10 that changes ùëö.
Sample 1.

Input:
2
Output:
2

2 = 1 + 1.

Sample 2.

Input:
28
Output:
6

28 = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1.

Strategy

Safe Move
The largest coin denomination is 10, so we should fill up the money with as many
10 value coins as possible until adding another 10 coin would be over capacity.

Subproblem:
Iterate through adding 10c coins trying to get up to m.
The last iteration of 10c coin adding will either be at value m or over m.
If it is over m, we would start adding 5c coins until m is reached.
If it is over value on the last iteration of 5c coins, we fill up the rest with
1c coins.

We have an accumulator variable that gets +1 on each new coin added, and it returns at the end.

Formula:
c = coins
m = money
V1 = 10
V2 = 5
V3 = 1

Complexity Analysis:
Time = 5 + (nlogn + 3) + (nlogn + 3) + (nlogn + 2)
     = 3(nlogn + 3) + 5
     = 3nlogn + 9 + 5
     = 3nlogn + 14
     = O(nlogn) Linear-Logarithmic Time...

     There will never be a time where we add nothing but pennies, such
     as 100 pennies for m of 100, since we start with the 10 cent coin denomination,
     then switch to 5 and 1 denominations when they can't fit in our m amount.
